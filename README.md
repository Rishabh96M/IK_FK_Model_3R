# IK_Model_3R
Inverse Kinematics model of a system having 1 roll motor and 2 pitch motors on MATLAB. Calculates all the angles for a given point of the end effector. You can also trace a given set of corordinates and visualize it on a graph.

# Requirments
Matlab R2015a or above

# Getting Started
Open the IK_FK_3R_trajectory.m function, change the link lengths vector (L vector) at the 11th line. You can change the parameters for the  trag function to modify the trajectory in the 13th line. If you wish to give a new trajectory function, you can replace it with trag function in the the 13th line, but please make sure the output of the function is the required format.
